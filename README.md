# 📝 Vanilla JS To-Do List App

A simple, minimal to-do list web application built with plain JavaScript. This app allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. All data is stored in the browser's `localStorage`, so your tasks persist even after a page reload.

## 🚀 Features

-   ✅ Add new tasks
-   🗂 Mark tasks as completed
-   🗑 Delete tasks
-   💾 Tasks are saved in `localStorage` and persist across sessions
-   ⚡ Lightweight and dependency-free

## 🔧 How It Works

-   When the page loads, it fetches saved tasks from `localStorage` and updates the UI.
-   You can add a task using the input field and button.
-   Click on a task to mark it as completed.
-   Click the ❌ delete icon to remove a task.
-   All changes are automatically saved to `localStorage`.
